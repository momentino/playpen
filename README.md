This is a modified version of clembench where we deal with agents instead of models. 
There are some changes compared to Clembench but (for now) the original documentation is mostly valid.



# clembench: A Framework for the Systematic Evaluation of Chat-Optimized Language Models as Conversational Agents

The cLLM (chat-optimized Large Language Model, "clem") framework tests such models' ability to engage in games – rule-constituted activities played using language.
The framework is a systematic way of probing for the situated language understanding of language using agents.

This repository contains the code for setting up the framework and implements a number of games that are further discussed in
